# Dominion
A Python implementation of the Dominion card game, with some test code as well.

The file testdompy.py is just unit tests written in Python, but another file I will leave is a .act file, which is used to do differential testing against another implementation.

The code for the .act file uses a test framework called TSTL, which was created by Oregon State University professor Alex Groce.
For more information on TSTL, please go to his github repository:
